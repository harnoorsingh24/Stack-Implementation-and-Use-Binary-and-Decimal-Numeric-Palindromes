# Stack-Implementation-and-Use-Binary-and-Decimal-Numeric-Palindromes
A palindrome is a word (or, in this case, a number) that reads the same forwards and backwards. In
this project you will find numbers that are palindromes in base 10 and check if their binary equivalents
are palindromes too. For example, 33 is a decimal palindrome. If you push the digits on a stack they
read the same as if they are in order. In this case I want you to store the palindrome in a list and a
stack and compare the digits one at a time. Then, assuming it is a palindrome in base 10, I want you to
convert it to binary and check if the binary equivalent is also a palindrome. If the number is both a
decimal and binary palindrome you will output the number and its binary equivalent on a line to report it.
